    abstract = { Organizations are continuously changing based on social, political, and economic conditions. HRD scholars and practitioners should think about new approaches to how they can engage with organizations and the people within them. Action research has been used as an approach in organization development for many years. While conventional action research has an emphasis on classical or traditional processes of inquiry, we present Community Based Participatory Action Research (CBPAR) as new research approach with an additional level of critical thought and engagement that is in alignment with Critical HRD. CBPAR aims to create knowledge and action, but also aims to empower members of communities or organization who are marginalized or oppressed. CBPAR offers an exciting and alterative approach to organizational research. }
